## Teardown an Environment

Suspending the virtual machine will stop it and save its current running state. Suspend the machine now.
```bash
  vagrant suspend
```
When you begin working again bring the machine back up and its state resumes from where you left off. Start the machine again.
```bash
  vagrant up
```
Halting the virtual machine will gracefully shut down the guest operating system and power down the guest machine. Halt your machine now.
```bash
  vagrant halt
```
